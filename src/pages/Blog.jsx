# Improving Aerobic Fitness for Young Sedentary Adults and the Benefits of Doing So
#### Kieran Khan ENGL393 Final Project 12/9/2024
Weight training dominates the minds of young adults, fueled by TikTok trends and the promise of visible results. But while strength training is the main source of exercise for many, aerobic fitness—often labeled as just “cardio”—is frequently overlooked. Cardio isn’t just about burning calories; it’s about enhancing the way your body delivers oxygen and uses energy, which can be especially transformative for those growing numbers of young adults with sedentary habits.

The benefits of aerobic fitness go far beyond appearances. It tackles many issues caused by prolonged sitting, including low energy, poor cardiovascular health, and reduced metabolic efficiency. By balancing weight training with cardio, you’ll see improvements in your overall fitness and health. Here’s why aerobic fitness is worth prioritizing—and how to start making it part of your life.

## The Benefits of Cardio for Sedentary Adults

#### 1. Increased Energy Levels
Fatigue is a common complaint among young adults who spend hours studying, working, or scrolling on their phones. Regular cardio can dramatically improve energy levels. A 2008 study showed that aerobic exercise boosts mitochondrial efficiency—the process by which your cells produce energy—helping you feel more awake and alert during the day.

#### 2. Reduced Risk of Early Death and Chronic Disease
The stakes are high for sedentary individuals: heart disease, diabetes, and even certain cancers are directly linked to inactivity. The National Institute of Health Research found that just 1.25 hours of moderate exercise per week reduced the risk of early death by 10%, with additional exercise offering even greater benefits. Consistent cardio strengthens your heart, improves blood flow, and helps regulate blood sugar levels—all crucial for long-term health.

#### 3. Better Heart Health
Your heart is a muscle, and like any other muscle, it gets stronger with use. Regular aerobic exercise improves your heart’s efficiency, enabling it to pump blood more effectively. Research by Patel et al. (2017) found that cardio can prevent up to 250,000 deaths annually in the U.S. by reducing risks related to cardiovascular diseases. This is especially important for young adults with sedentary lifestyles, as early prevention is key.

#### 4. Enhanced Cognitive Function
Aerobic fitness doesn’t just make your body stronger—it sharpens your mind. Studies like the one conducted by Solberg et al. (2022) reveal a link between aerobic activity and improved academic performance, particularly in math and problem-solving. For young adults juggling school, work, and other responsibilities, cardio can provide the mental clarity needed to excel.

#### 5. Improved Fitness Metrics: VO2 Max and Recovery
VO2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise, is a key measure of aerobic fitness. Higher VO2 max means you’ll perform better during physical activities and recover faster afterward. Activities like running, cycling, and swimming consistently improve this metric, setting a solid foundation for overall health.

## How to Improve Aerobic Fitness: Scientific and Practical Strategies
Improving aerobic fitness isn’t just about running on a treadmill until you’re exhausted. It’s about understanding your body’s needs and gradually increasing its capacity to use oxygen effectively. Let’s break it down:

### Scientific Perspective: What Happens When You Do Cardio
When you engage in aerobic exercise, your body undergoes several key changes:

- Increased Cardiac Output: Your heart pumps more blood, delivering oxygen to your muscles more efficiently. \n
- Improved Mitochondrial Function: Aerobic training enhances the energy-producing structures in your cells, improving endurance and reducing fatigue. \n
- Greater Capillary Density: Regular exercise encourages the growth of new capillaries, enhancing nutrient and oxygen delivery to tissues. \n
These adaptations take time but can start showing results after just a few weeks of consistent effort.

### A Practical Guide to Getting Started With Cardio For Beginners
Everyone starts at different levels of fitness, so don't start expecting to be doing 5 mile runs out of the gate. Start with activities like brisk walking or cycling for as low as 10–15 minutes a day, but 30 minutes is recommended. As you feel more comfortable, gradually increase the duration or intensity.
For those who’ve been sedentary for a while, high-impact exercises like running might feel intimidating or uncomfortable. Swimming, elliptical training, or rowing are excellent low-impact alternatives that don't stress your joints and lower chance of injury.
High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is effective for increasing VO2 max; it alternates short bursts of intense effort with periods of rest. For example, sprint for 30 seconds, then walk for a minute. HIIT is efficient, helping you build aerobic fitness and burn calories in less time.
Use apps or fitness trackers to monitor your heart rate, steps, or VO2 max improvements. Seeing progress, no matter how small, can be a huge motivator to keep going. Wearable fitness trackers like Apple Watch, Fitbit, or Garmin are widely recommended.
While cardio improves your heart and lungs, weight training strengthens muscles and bones. Aim to include both in your routine for a balanced approach to fitness.

## In-Depth: Zone 2 Training vs. VO2 Max Training
To elevate your aerobic fitness, it’s important to train both your base aerobic capacity (Zone 2) and your maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). Each serves a different purpose and comes with its own set of benefits and challenges.

### Zone 2 Training: The Foundation of Aerobic Fitness
#### What It Is:
Zone 2 training refers to exercising at a low-to-moderate intensity, typically 60–70% of your maximum heart rate. You should be able to carry on a conversation while training in this zone without feeling breathless.

#### Benefits:

Increased Fat Utilization: Zone 2 training improves your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel, enhancing endurance.
Cardiovascular Efficiency: It strengthens your heart and improves mitochondrial function over time.
Low Stress: This type of training minimizes wear and tear on the body, making it sustainable over long periods.
Drawbacks:

Results can be slow to manifest.
May feel "boring" to those who prefer high-intensity workouts.
How to Implement:

Duration: Aim for 45–90 minutes per session, 2–4 times per week.
Ideal Activities: Running, cycling, swimming, or brisk walking at a steady, easy pace.
Heart Rate Monitoring: Use a fitness tracker to stay within your Zone 2 heart rate range.

### VO2 Max Training: Pushing Your Limits
#### What It Is:
VO2 max training involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise performed at or near your maximum capacity. This typically falls within 90–100% of your maximum heart rate.

#### Benefits:

Increased Aerobic Ceiling: Boosts your body’s ability to utilize oxygen during intense activity.
Improved Speed and Power: Enhances performance for athletes who need bursts of energy.
Time-Efficient: Delivers significant results in a shorter time frame compared to Zone 2.
Drawbacks:

Intense sessions can be physically and mentally draining.
Higher risk of overtraining and injury if overdone.
How to Implement:

Duration: Perform intervals lasting 1–4 minutes at high intensity, followed by equal rest periods, for a total of 20–40 minutes per session, 1–2 times per week.
Example Workout: 6 x 3-minute intervals at 90% of max effort, with 3 minutes of recovery in between.
Ideal Activities: Sprints, cycling, rowing, or uphill running.

## Structuring Your Weekly Aerobic Training
To strike a balance between building your aerobic base and pushing your limits, follow these general guidelines:

#### 1. Training Frequency
Beginner-Intermediate: 3–4 cardio sessions per week.
Intermediate-Advanced: 5–6 sessions per week, with a mix of Zone 2 and VO2 max workouts. \n
#### 2. Training Distribution
80/20 Rule: Many endurance athletes swear by this approach, which dedicates 80% of training time to low-intensity (Zone 2) workouts and 20% to high-intensity (VO2 max) efforts.
Example Weekly Breakdown (for 5 sessions):
3 sessions of Zone 2 (45–90 minutes each).
1 VO2 max session (20–40 minutes of intervals).
1 recovery-focused session (light activity like yoga, walking, or easy cycling). \n
#### 3. Total Training Time
Aim for 4–10 hours of cardio per week, depending on your fitness level and goals. Adjust based on how your body feels.
4. Recovery is Key
Overtraining leads to diminished performance and increased risk of injury. Use at least 1–2 days for light activity or rest.

### The Science Behind Combining Zone 2 and VO2 Max
#### Zone 2 and VO2 max training complement each other in important ways:

Zone 2 Builds the Base: Think of it as laying the foundation of a house. Without a strong aerobic base, your high-intensity training won’t be as effective.
VO2 Max Expands Your Limits: High-intensity work pushes your “ceiling,” allowing you to perform better at both low and high intensities.
Research supports this combination as the most effective way to improve overall cardiovascular fitness, endurance, and performance.

## Tracking Your Progress
#### To ensure your training is effective, keep an eye on these key metrics:

Resting Heart Rate (RHR): A lower RHR over time indicates improved fitness.\n
VO2 Max Estimates: Many fitness trackers provide VO2 max estimates based on your performance. \n
Perceived Effort: Over time, workouts that once felt hard will feel easier—a clear sign of progress. \n
Performance Metrics: Track improvements in run pace, cycling power output, or swimming times.\n

## Conclusion
Improving aerobic fitness when you’re already active isn’t just about piling on more miles or spending hours in the gym. It’s about training smarter by balancing intensity, focusing on recovery, and using scientific principles to guide your progress.

By blending Zone 2 and VO2 max training into your weekly routine, you’ll dramatically strengthen aerobic base while pushing your limits for peak performance.

Hopefully this blog post has inspired you to want to start training for aerobic fitness and has given you a comprehensive guide on doing so.
